It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\nNote that unless prior permission is agreed in writing with the editor of RWDS, only the editor and editorial board of RWDS may officially represent the community. Comment to the media must only be given by appointed representatives and must be approved by the RSS press office.\n\n\nEnforcement\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at b.tarran@rss.org.uk. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.\n\n\nEnforcement guidelines\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n1. Correction\nCommunity Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\nConsequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n\n2. Warning\nCommunity Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.\nConsequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n\n3. Temporary Ban\nCommunity Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\nConsequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n\n4. Permanent Ban\nCommunity Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\nConsequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.\n\n\n\nAttribution\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by Mozilla’s code of conduct enforcement ladder.\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.
