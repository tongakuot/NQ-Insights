To elevate the patient quality of care, healthcare organizations must know how to leverage cutting-edge open-source tools to gain valuable insights from healthcare data. NQI helps South Sudanese healthcare companies achieve this with business intelligence and analytic tools such as Plotly Dash, Python Shiny, and R Shiny.

Understanding data visualization best practices helps data scientists and analysts choose appropriate DataViz tools so that decision-makers will focus on improving patient quality outcomes rather than waste valuable time sifting through a clutter of visuals that add no value.

With over seven years of healthcare analytics, our team ensures you use the right tools for the right job to obtain actionable insights from your data. Both R and Python provide a plethora of visualization tools for publication-ready visuals.
